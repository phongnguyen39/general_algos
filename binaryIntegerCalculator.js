// Title: Counting in the Binary System

// Background: Decimal numbers includes integar symbols that includes 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.  
// Binary only has 0's and 1's; 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 are excluded

// To count in binary, it helps to think about counting in the decimal system first. 
//  Example 1: The number, 4, is represented as simply '4'.  In binary it is 100.  

// Algorithmic steps:  
// if number is a multiple of two, then the number of increases
// 0,2,4,8,16,32
// 32 here consists of some combination of 16's + 8's + 4's + 2's + 1's

let decimalNumberToBinary =(dnum)=>{
    
}
